# Claude ↔ Codex Handoff

A drop-in kit that lets two AI coding agents — for example **Claude Code** and
**Codex** — collaborate asynchronously inside one repository. They talk through
append-only files: one message stream per direction, atomic leases, and
per-session cursors with legacy shared cursor anchors. No server, no daemon.
Each side wakes on a timer, processes unread
messages, optionally hands work back, and exits.

It installs as a single **`.handoff/` folder in your project**, shared by both
agents. There is no separate global "skill" copy to keep in sync — Claude Code
and Codex read the same files.

## Install (into your project)

From your project root, clone this repo as `.handoff/`, then run setup:

```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/OpenMOSS/claude-codex-handoff.git .handoff

# macOS / Linux / WSL:
bash .handoff/setup.sh
# Windows:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .handoff\setup.ps1
```

Don't want to type the shell command yourself? Open the project in **Claude
Code** or **Codex** and ask the agent to **run `.handoff/setup.sh`** (Windows:
**`.handoff\setup.ps1`**) — it can see the script in your tree and will run it
for you. Setup is what copies `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` into your project root;
*after* that the agents have an entry file, so saying **`启动协作`** (or
**`costart`**) kicks off the actual collaboration — see [Quick start](#quick-start-start-a-collaboration)
below. (Before setup runs, a bare `启动协作` won't work: with no root entry file
yet, the agent has no way to know `.handoff/` exists.)

`setup` creates `.handoff-runtime/` (live state) and copies `PROJECT.md` /
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` to your project root if they're absent. From then on
Claude Code (via `CLAUDE.md`) and Codex (via `AGENTS.md`) both read the same
`.handoff/`. Update later with `git -C .handoff pull`.

> **Git note.** `.handoff/` is itself a git clone. Always add **`.handoff-runtime/`**
> to your project's `.gitignore`. For `.handoff/` itself, either keep it as an
> updatable dependency (add `.handoff/` to `.gitignore`, `git -C .handoff pull` to
> update) or vendor it into your repo (`rm -rf .handoff/.git`, then commit the files).

## Quick start: start a collaboration

In **each** agent, open the project and say **`启动协作`** — or **`costart`**, or "start collaboration". That's all you type — the agents do the rest, including calling `send.py` themselves.

**Hand over a goal in the same breath.** Append a task objective after the trigger — **`启动协作：检查第一章事实`** / **`costart: review chapter 1 facts`** — and the agents take it as the opening task and drive it autonomously, **talking it through with each other** (`question` / `handoff`) as they go, looping until the goal is met. Each side weighs the other's ideas on the merits rather than just agreeing — push back, ask for evidence, offer a better option; the goal is a high-quality result, not a quick consensus. When a judgment call comes up, the two of them hash it out between themselves first instead of bouncing it back to you; they escalate to you only when they genuinely can't agree, or for anything out-of-scope / destructive per `PROTOCOL.md` §12 (hard limits the agents can't waive on their own). No step-by-step babysitting.

**Claude side:** in the project, say `启动协作`. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` → `.handoff/PROTOCOL.md`, runs setup if needed, helps you fill `PROJECT.md`, creates its recurring cron (`prompts/cron-prompt.md`), does a first poll, and sends Codex your first task.

**Codex side:**

Open the project in the Codex App and say `启动协作`. Codex reads `AGENTS.md` → `.handoff/PROTOCOL.md`, runs setup if needed, sets up its ~10-min heartbeat automation (`prompts/codex-heartbeat-prompt.md`), and does a first poll.

**Then it runs itself.** Each side wakes on its timer, reads its inbox stream, claims and completes any `task` / `handoff` / `question`, replies with `done`, and goes quiet when there's nothing to do.

## How it works

- **Two streams.** `claude-to-codex.jsonl` (Claude writes, Codex reads) and `codex-to-claude.jsonl` (the reverse). Append-only; a written line is never edited.
- **Message types.** `task`, `handoff`, `question`, `done`, `status`, `error`, `cancel`. Lease-bearing types need an atomic claim before processing; `status` and `done` are pure-consumption.
- **Per-session cursors + leases.** Each running session tracks its own cursor under `.handoff-runtime/cursors/`; legacy `.codex-cursor` / `.claude-cursor` files are compatibility anchors. Work items are claimed via atomic file creation under `.handoff-runtime/claims/`. Iron law: **side effects first, advance cursor last** — so nothing is lost on a crash or interruption.
- **No daemons.** Claude uses a recurring cron (every ~10 min); Codex uses a Codex App heartbeat. Each fire is one bounded pass; idle fires exit quietly.
- **Multi-session safe.** Optional `from_session` / `to_session` labels let two same-side sessions run without stealing each other's replies; a per-side send lock serializes id assignment.

See [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) for the full specification.

## The two sides

|                | Claude side                               | Codex side                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entry file     | `CLAUDE.md`                               | `AGENTS.md`                                                |
| Wake mechanism | recurring cron (`prompts/cron-prompt.md`) | Codex App heartbeat (`prompts/codex-heartbeat-prompt.md`) |
| Writes to      | `claude-to-codex.jsonl`                   | `codex-to-claude.jsonl`                                   |

## Sending a message

The agents use the helper themselves; you rarely call it directly:

```bash
python .handoff/tools/send.py --side claude --type task \
  --summary "review the auth refactor" --goal "list correctness risks"

python .handoff/tools/send.py --side codex --type done \
  --reply-to claude-000001 --summary "reviewed, 2 findings in notes" \
  --notes-file notes/codex-000005.md
```

The helper assigns ids under a lock, stamps every required field, and serializes concurrent sends. Add `--dry-run` to preview without writing.

## Runtime diagnostics

When a collaboration appears stuck or noisy, run the read-only doctor from the
project root:

```bash
python .handoff/tools/doctor.py
```

It checks stream JSON, local seq files, session cursors, legacy cursor anchors,
claims, and unexpected runtime files. It does not modify project or runtime
state.
